# Volvo Cars (Global Online Digital)

## Front-end coding test (React)

Our team's designer has come up with a new design to show our latest and greatest recharge cars on the website.

Here is how the design look like for desktop and mobile (files are stored under `docs` folder)

### Desktop

### Mobile

The data required to render the design is under `public/api/cars.json` folder. You need to fetch the data and render it in the browser. The data looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "xc90-recharge",
    "modelName": "XC90 Recharge",
    "bodyType": "suv",
    "modelType": "plug-in hybrid",
    "imageUrl": "/images/xc90_recharge.jpg"
  }
]
